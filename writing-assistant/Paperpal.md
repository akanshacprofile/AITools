# Paperpal
 :pen: **AI tool for academic writing!**

Tired of giving prompts to ChatGPT for academic researches, tired of the hallucianations and ChatGPT always saying yes to whatever you ask, **Paperpal** is your academic writing companion and is the AI tool to go to for any kind of research.  

# ChatGPT vs Paperpal ⚖️
1. ChatGPT is general-purpose and may need more specific prompting to match academic conventions. Whereas, Paperpal is specifically designed for academic writing. It offers features like context-aware rewrite suggestions, grammar/style checks geared toward scholarly tone, and research writing assistance.
2. ChatGPT can generate citations, but it doesn’t natively format or validate them reliably without careful prompting. Whereas, Paperpal can help generate, format, and verify citations in academic styles.
3. ChatGPT doesn’t offer built-in plagiarism checking. Whereas, Paperpal plans include plagiarism detection and similarity reports, which help ensure originality.
4. ChatGPT requires you to input/submit text, then receive output separately. It isn’t embedded directly into your writing workflow by default. Whereas, Paperpal often works within the document you’re writing (like in a Word plugin or editor extension), providing inline suggestions as you compose.
5. ChatGPT is broad-domain and may produce phrasing that’s too general without explicit direction. Whereas, Paperpal’s models are tuned to academic voice and discipline-specific phrasing, which can make outputs more suitable for research contexts.

# Core Architecture ⚙️
Paperpal is not built on a single third-party model; rather, it utilizes a multi-model engine that combines proprietary technology with specialized Large Language Models (LLMs). 

**Its core architecture includes:** 
- **Proprietary Scholarly Models:** Paperpal features its own homegrown generative AI suite specifically trained on millions of published research articles and academic literature to ensure its suggestions align with scholarly conventions.
- **Feature-Specific AI:** The platform employs a variety of AI models, selecting the one best suited for specific tasks like grammar correction, contextual rewriting, or translation.
- **Cross-Verifying Models:** For its AI detection tools, Paperpal uses multiple models to cross-verify text, which reportedly reduces false positives by over 40% compared to single-model systems.
